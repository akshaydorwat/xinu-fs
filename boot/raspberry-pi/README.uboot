- u-boot.bin - This is the u-boot binary. This is lanunched instead of kernel.img. This was compiled from the source at https://github.com/gonzoua/u-boot-pi 
- boot-tftp.cmd - This is the uncompiled u-boot script. This tells u-boot to start the usb and ethernet devices, download kernel.img, and jump to 0x10000
- boot.scr - This is the compiled u-boot script. This must keep its name, u-boot looks for this file specifically.
- uEnv.txt - This contains the environment variables for u-boot. For tftp you must assign an ip-address to the RPi and configure where the tftp server is
- config.txt - This file has been updated to tell the GPU to load u-boot.bin instead of kernel.img
